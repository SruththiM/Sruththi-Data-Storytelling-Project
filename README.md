# Sruththi-Data-Storytelling-Project
A personal data storytelling project analyzing how physical activity impacts concentration, stress levels, sleep, and academic performance across different life phases.

## Project Overview
This project explores how physical activity influences concentration, stress, sleep patterns, and academic performance using a self-inspired dataset.

## Dataset
- Past Active Phase (high physical activity)
- Present Less Active Phase (reduced physical activity)

The dataset includes:
- Study hours
- Sleep duration
- Physical activity
- Concentration score
- Stress level
- Academic marks

## Key Insight
When Sruththi was physically active, concentration and academic performance were high.
After stopping physical activity, stress increased and academic performance declined — even with increased study hours.

## Tools Used
- Excel
- CSV Dataset
- Data Visualization
- Data Storytelling

## Conclusion
This project highlights the importance of physical activity in maintaining mental well-being and academic performance, especially for students.
